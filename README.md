# Project Overview
This project was designed to investigate the use of Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. The experiments were performed about a year ago, so prior to the extraordinary inflation we saw in 2022. This means we could reexamine the results of using Bitcoin as a hedge against inflation today and we would probably see that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are probably not a great hedge against inflation compared to standard assets like gold and REITs. Regardless, here are some of our results from the project:
